fountain_emacs
==============

Emacs syntax highlighting for the Fountain script markdown

------

This was written for Aquamacs.

Installation:
1) Copy fountain.el into your ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs folder.
2) Put this line in your Preferences.el file:

(load "~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/fountain.el")

This should activate fountain-mode for .fountain files by default the next time you restart Aquamacs.

You can set the 'fountain mode' default font to Courier by going to Options->Appearance.

It's a work in progress! Tweet notes to @NajeebTarazi.
