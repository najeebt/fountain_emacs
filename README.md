fountain_emacs
==============

Emacs syntax highlighting for the Fountain script markdown

------

This was written for Aquamacs. Copy it into your ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs folder to get fountain-mode for .fountain files by default.

You can set the 'fountain mode' default font to Courier by going to Options->Appearance.

It's a work in progress! Tweet notes to @NajeebTarazi.
